h1. Morphological Analysis Plugin for ElasticSearch

The Morphological Analysis plugin integrates <a href="https://github.com/imotov/russianmorphology">Russian and English morphology for java and lucene framework</a> into elasticsearch. This plugin adds two new analyzers: "russian_morphology" and "english_morphology" and two token filters with the same names.
